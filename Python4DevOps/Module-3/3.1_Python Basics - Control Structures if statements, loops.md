# 3.1 Python Basics - Control Structures (if statements, loops).

### 1. `if` Statements (Conditional Statements)

**What are they?**  
An `if` statement is a conditional statement that executes a block of code only if a specified condition is `True`. You can also add `elif` (else if) and `else` clauses to handle multiple conditions.

**Examples:**

```python
# Example 1: Simple `if` statement
cpu_usage = 85

if cpu_usage > 80:
    print("Warning: High CPU usage detected!")

# Example 2: `if-elif-else` structure
disk_space = 50

if disk_space < 20:
    print("Critical: Disk space is very low!")
elif disk_space < 50:
    print("Warning: Disk space is low.")
else:
    print("Disk space is sufficient.")
```

**Explanation:**
- **Example 1**: The `if` statement checks if `cpu_usage` is greater than 80. If `True`, it prints a warning message.
- **Example 2**: The `if-elif-else` structure evaluates multiple conditions: If `disk_space` is below 20, it prints a critical message; if between 20 and 50, a warning; otherwise, it prints that disk space is sufficient.

**DevOps Use Case:**  
In DevOps automation scripts, `if` statements are used to create conditions for different tasks. For example, you can use them to check if certain resources are available, trigger alerts based on usage thresholds, or deploy applications only if certain conditions are met (e.g., deploying only if the staging environment has passed all tests).

### 2. Loops (`for` and `while` Loops)

**What are they?**  
Loops are control structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python has two main types of loops:
- **`for` loop**: Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range).
- **`while` loop**: Repeats as long as a specified condition is `True`.

**Examples:**

```python
# Example 1: `for` loop
server_list = ["server1", "server2", "server3"]

for server in server_list:
    print(f"Pinging {server}...")

# Example 2: `while` loop
retry_count = 0
max_retries = 3

while retry_count < max_retries:
    print("Attempting to connect to the server...")
    # Imagine some code here to try connecting to a server
    retry_count += 1
```

**Explanation:**
- **Example 1**: The `for` loop iterates over each server in `server_list` and prints a message for each, simulating a ping to each server.
- **Example 2**: The `while` loop repeats the connection attempt until `retry_count` reaches `max_retries`. Each time the connection attempt is made, `retry_count` is incremented, allowing the loop to exit after three attempts.

**DevOps Use Case:**  
Loops are essential in DevOps for automating repetitive tasks. For example:
- **`for` loops** are useful for iterating over a list of servers to perform actions (e.g., deploying applications, collecting logs, checking system status).
- **`while` loops** are helpful when you need to retry an operation, such as attempting to reconnect to a service or re-running a task until it completes successfully.
