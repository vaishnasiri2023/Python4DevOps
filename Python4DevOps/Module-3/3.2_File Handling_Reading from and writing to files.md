# File Handling 

## Reading from and writing to files.

In Python, reading from and writing to files is done using the built-in `open()` function, which allows you to interact with files in various modes. Below, I'll cover the basics with examples of reading from and writing to files.

### Basic File Modes in Python

- `'r'`: Read (default mode). Opens a file for reading.
- `'w'`: Write. Opens a file for writing (overwrites the file if it exists).
- `'a'`: Append. Opens a file for writing but does not erase existing data (adds to the end of the file).
- `'b'`: Binary mode. Used with other modes (e.g., `'rb'`, `'wb'`) to work with binary files.
- `'r+'`: Read and write. Opens the file for both reading and writing.

### Example 1: Writing to a File

This example writes a string of text to a file using the `'w'` (write) mode.

```python
# Open the file in write mode
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    # Write a line of text to the file
    file.write("Hello, this is a sample text for the file.\n")
    file.write("This text is written to demonstrate file writing in Python.\n")
```

#### Explanation
- `open('example.txt', 'w')`: Opens the file `example.txt` in write mode.
- `file.write(...)`: Writes a line of text to the file. If the file does not exist, it is created.
- The `with` statement ensures the file is properly closed after the block of code is executed.

### Example 2: Reading from a File

This example reads the content of a file using the `'r'` (read) mode.

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read the entire content of the file
    content = file.read()

# Print the content
print("File Content:\n", content)
```

#### Explanation
- `open('example.txt', 'r')`: Opens the file `example.txt` in read mode.
- `file.read()`: Reads the entire content of the file and stores it in the variable `content`.
- `print(content)`: Outputs the content of the file.

### Example 3: Appending to a File

If you want to add more data to an existing file without overwriting its content, use the `'a'` (append) mode.

```python
# Open the file in append mode
with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:
    # Add a new line of text
    file.write("This line is added to demonstrate appending to a file.\n")
```

#### Explanation
- `open('example.txt', 'a')`: Opens `example.txt` in append mode.
- `file.write(...)`: Appends the specified text to the end of the file without deleting existing content.

### Example 4: Reading a File Line-by-Line

This is useful if you want to process a file one line at a time, such as in log files.

```python
# Open the file in read mode
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Iterate through each line in the file
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # Print each line without extra newline characters
```

#### Explanation
- `for line in file`: Reads the file line by line.
- `line.strip()`: Removes any leading/trailing whitespace (like newline characters).

### Example 5: Reading and Writing in Binary Mode

Binary mode is often used for non-text files, such as images or audio files.

```python
# Writing binary data
data = b"Some binary data"
with open('binary_example.bin', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(data)

# Reading binary data
with open('binary_example.bin', 'rb') as file:
    binary_content = file.read()
print(binary_content)
```

#### Explanation
- `open('binary_example.bin', 'wb')`: Opens a file in write-binary mode.
- `file.write(data)`: Writes binary data to the file.
- `open('binary_example.bin', 'rb')`: Opens the file in read-binary mode and reads the content.


### Example 5: To read specific lines, such as lines 10 to 15, from a file in Python

To read specific lines, such as lines 10 to 15, from a file in Python, you can use the following script. This script opens the file in read mode, iterates through it line by line, and only processes the lines within the specified range.

Here's an example Python script to read lines 10 to 15 from a file.

```python
# Define the start and end line numbers
start_line = 10
end_line = 15

# Open the file in read mode
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Loop through the file with line numbers using enumerate
    for current_line_number, line_content in enumerate(file, start=1):
        # Check if the line is within the specified range
        if start_line <= current_line_number <= end_line:
            print(f"Line {current_line_number}: {line_content.strip()}")
        # Stop reading if we've passed the end line
        elif current_line_number > end_line:
            break
```

### Explanation

1. `start_line` and `end_line` define the range of lines you want to read (e.g., lines 10 to 15).
2. `with open('example.txt', 'r') as file`: Opens the file in read mode.
3. `enumerate(file, start=1)`: Enumerates over each line in the file, starting line numbering at 1.
4. `if start_line <= current_line_number <= end_line`: Checks if the current line number is within the specified range (lines 10 to 15).
5. `print(f"Line {current_line_number}: {line_content.strip()}")`: Prints the line content, stripping any extra whitespace.
6. `elif current_line_number > end_line`: Stops reading the file after line 15 to save resources.
