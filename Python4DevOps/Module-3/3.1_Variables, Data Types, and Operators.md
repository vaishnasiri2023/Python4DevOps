# 3.1 Python Basics - (Variables, Data Types, and Operators.)

### 1. Variables
**What are they?**  
A variable in Python is a named storage location that holds a value. You assign a value to a variable using the `=` sign, and the variable stores that value until you change it.

**Examples:**

```python
server_ip = "192.168.1.1"  # String variable storing IP address
cpu_threshold = 80  # Integer variable storing CPU usage threshold in percentage
```

**Explanation:**  
- In `server_ip`, we've stored an IP address as a string, which could represent a server's address.
- In `cpu_threshold`, we've stored a number (integer), which might represent the CPU usage threshold for triggering alerts in a monitoring setup.

**DevOps Use Case:**  
Variables can hold configurations or threshold values (like IP addresses or usage limits) used in scripts for automation tasks, such as server health checks, setting up alerts, or defining paths for deployments.

### 2. Data Types
**What are they?**  
Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold. Common data types in Python include:
- **String** (`str`): Text data
- **Integer** (`int`): Whole numbers
- **Float** (`float`): Decimal numbers
- **Boolean** (`bool`): `True` or `False` values

**Examples:**

```python
server_name = "webserver1"  # String data type
memory_usage = 64.5  # Float data type representing memory usage in GB
is_deployed = True  # Boolean data type indicating deployment status
```

**Explanation:**  
- `server_name` is a string, storing the name of the server.
- `memory_usage` is a float, representing memory consumption.
- `is_deployed` is a boolean, which could indicate if the deployment was successful.

**DevOps Use Case:**  
Data types are critical in DevOps for handling different types of informationâ€”such as logging server names, tracking metrics, or managing conditional statements in scripts. For instance, a boolean can control flow in automation scripts, allowing certain actions only when a condition (e.g., `is_deployed`) is `True`.

### 3. Operators
**What are they?**  
Operators in Python are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They include:
- **Arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- **Comparison operators** (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`)
- **Logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`)

**Examples:**

```python
# Arithmetic operator example
total_servers = 10
active_servers = 8
inactive_servers = total_servers - active_servers  # Subtraction operator

# Comparison operator example
is_threshold_exceeded = cpu_threshold > 75  # Checks if CPU usage exceeds 75%
```

**Explanation:**  
- `inactive_servers` calculates the number of inactive servers by subtracting `active_servers` from `total_servers`.
- `is_threshold_exceeded` is a boolean that checks if `cpu_threshold` is above 75, which could be useful for triggering an alert.

**DevOps Use Case:**  
Operators are essential in writing conditions and loops in automation scripts. For example, in a deployment script, you might use comparison and logical operators to check if certain metrics (like CPU or memory usage) exceed a defined threshold before scaling services or triggering alerts.

In DevOps, understanding and effectively using variables, data types, and operators allows you to build robust scripts for configuration management, monitoring, and automated infrastructure setup, ensuring smooth and efficient pipeline workflows.
